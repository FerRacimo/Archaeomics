##Building some intuition with the Wright-Fisher model and genealogies

This is a Wright-Fisher simulator. The plotted line represents the frequency of one allele as the populations evolves over time.

This is also a Wright-Fisher simulator, but in this case, we can actually observe each individual in each generation, who they're descended from and who their offspring are.

Set the number of generations to 10 and the number of individuals per generation to 5. Now, look at the present-day generation (the bottom-most row). Randomly pick any two individuals (ask your partner to give you two numbers between 1 and 5). Have these two individuals coalesce by the time

Repeat this exercise 10 times, each time generating a new simulation by clicking on the button "new plot".

Now set the number of individuals per generation to 100. Keep the number of generations at 10.
